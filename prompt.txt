You act as a automation developer .Follow below step and give proper code in python.
Step 1: You need to extract data from a table on a webpage using Selenium and store it in a CSV file.
Step 2: The webpage you're interested in is "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-hashtable-and-concurrenthashmap-in-java".
Step 3: Write a Python script using Selenium to accomplish this task.
Step 4: Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable.
Step 5: Configure Chrome options to run Chrome in headless mode (optional).
Step 6: Initialize the ChromeDriver.
Step 7: Open the webpage.
Step 8: Find the table element on the webpage.
Step 9: Extract the headers from the table.
Step 10: Extract the rows of data from the table.
Step 11: Close the WebDriver.
Step 12: Write the extracted data to a CSV file named "table_data.csv".
Step 13: Display a message indicating that the data has been saved successfully.


--------------------------------------------------

import csv
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Set the path to your ChromeDriver executable
chrome_driver_path = '/path/to/chromedriver'

# Configure Chrome options (optional)
chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
chrome_options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run Chrome in headless mode

# Initialize ChromeDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)

# Open the webpage
driver.get('https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-hashtable-and-concurrenthashmap-in-java')

# Find the table element
table = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//table[@class="table table-bordered"]')

# Get the headers
headers = [header.text for header in table.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/th')]

# Get the rows
rows = []
for row in table.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/tbody/tr'):
    row_data = [cell.text for cell in row.find_elements(By.XPATH, './/td')]
    rows.append(row_data)

# Close the WebDriver
driver.quit()

# Write data to a CSV file
filename = 'table_data.csv'
with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(headers)
    writer.writerows(rows)

print(f'Data saved to {filename}')

RDBMS to NOSQL

1. You're working on a Python script to migrate SQL queries to their NoSQL equivalents for MongoDB. Begin by importing the necessary libraries.

2.Now, it's time to create the core function responsible for converting the SQL query to its NoSQL equivalent. You'll use the sqlparse library for parsing the SQL query.

3.You decide to test your function with a sample SQL query and execute the NoSQL query using a MongoDB client.

4.After running the script, you should see the original SQL query, the table name, and its NoSQL equivalent printed to the console. You decide to further test and improve the code to handle more complex SQL queries and different database structures.


------------------------------------------------------
File Format Conversion

User
1. Give the Python script .  That the script will take input data in one format and convert it to another format. Provide an overview of the two formats involved and any important details about their structures.

2. Start by validating the input data to ensure it adheres to the expected format. Display an error message and exit the script if the input format is incorrect or incomplete.

3. Extract relevant data from the input file according to its original format. If the input format is structured (e.g., JSON, XML), use appropriate libraries or parsing techniques to access the required information.

4. Create a mapping between the elements of the input format and the corresponding elements in the output format. This mapping will dictate how the data is converted from one format to another. Use a dictionary or lookup table to define this mapping clearly.

5.Iterate through the input data and apply the defined mapping to convert each element to the corresponding format in the output data structure. Handle any required data type conversions or validations during this step.

6.Assemble the transformed data into the desired output format. Ensure that the output adheres to the specific rules and conventions of the target format.

7.Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch any unexpected issues that may arise during the transformation process. Provide informative error messages to help users understand and resolve problems efficiently.


---------------------------------------------------------------
1.Develop an automation script using Selenium WebDriver and Python. Import the required libraries, such as requests, selenium, webdriver, By, WebDriverWait, and expected_conditions.

2.Configure the WebDriver (e.g., Chrome WebDriver) to interact with the web application. Maximize the window and set up a wait instance for explicit waits.

3.Set the API endpoint and the URL of the web application that you want to test.

4.Write a function to send an HTTP GET request to the API and retrieve the response data in JSON format.

5.Create a function to interact with the web UI using Selenium WebDriver. This may include actions like navigating to the URL, entering data, clicking buttons, etc.

6.Develop a function to compare the data obtained from the API with the data fetched from the UI. Validate data consistency between the API and UI responses.

7.In the main block, execute the test by calling the functions to perform API calls, UI interactions, and data comparison. Handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.
