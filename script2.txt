HTTP-REQUEST USING URL-STR, REQ-TYPE, REQ-BODY, RESP-DATA.
    * Implementation of HTTP request goes here.
    * Make use of the URL-STR, REQ-TYPE, REQ-BODY, and RESP-DATA parameters
    * to perform the appropriate HTTP request.
    * This is typically done using HTTP client libraries or custom socket programming.
    * Ensure proper error handling and response parsing.
    * Example: use CURL or HTTP client library to send the HTTP request.
    DISPLAY "Performing HTTP request..."
    DISPLAY "URL: " URL-STR
    DISPLAY "Request Type: " REQ-TYPE
    DISPLAY "Request Body: " REQ-BODY

User story of above cobol code.


User Story     	Description
U1             I want to add a user to the system.	- The system should send an HTTP POST request to "http://example.com/users" with the user's name, email, and password in JSON format.<br>- The system should receive a response from the server and store it in the WS-RESPONSE variable.
U2             I want to get all users from the system.	- The system should send an HTTP GET request to "http://example.com/users".<br>- The system should receive a response from the server and store it in the WS-RESPONSE variable.
U3             I want to get a specific user by their ID.	- The system should send an HTTP GET request to "http://example.com/users/{user_id}" where {user_id} is the user's ID.<br>- The system should receive a response from the server and store it in the WS-RESPONSE variable.
U4             I want to update a user's information.	- The system should send an HTTP PUT request to "http://example.com/users/{user_id}" where {user_id} is the user's ID.<br>- The system should include the user's updated name in the request body as JSON.<br>- The system should receive a response from the server and store it in the WS-RESPONSE variable.
U5             I want to delete a user from the system.	- The system should send an HTTP DELETE request to "http://example.com/users/{user_id}" where {user_id} is the user's ID.<br>- The system should receive a response from the server and store it in the WS-RESPONSE variable.
